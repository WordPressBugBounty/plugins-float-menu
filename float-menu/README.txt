== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The menu does not appear on the website. How can I fix it? =
If the menu does not appear, it may be due to **caching**. Try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Clear your browser cache** – press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) to refresh the page without cache.
2. **Clear your WordPress cache** – if you're using a caching plugin (e.g., WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, LiteSpeed Cache), clear the cache in the plugin settings.
3. **Purge server cache** – if your hosting provider uses caching (e.g., Cloudflare, SiteGround, or Nginx cache), clear the cache from your hosting panel.
4. **Disable caching temporarily** – if the issue persists, try disabling the caching plugin and check if the menu appears.

= The menu is visible to the site administrator but not to users? =
Check if the **"Test Mode"** option is enabled in the menu settings. If **Test Mode** is activated, the menu will be visible **only to the site administrator** (logged-in users with administrative rights). This is useful for configuring and testing your menu before making it public.

= How do "Mobile Rules" work on mobile devices? =
When **Mobile Rules** are enabled, the menu uses a two-step interaction on touch screens: the **first click** shows the menu item label (tooltip), and the **second click** opens the link. This prevents accidental navigation and improves user experience on mobile.

= Can I change the menu position or fix overlapping issues? =
Yes! You can set the menu to appear on the **left or right side**. If the menu is hidden behind other elements or overlaps them, you can adjust the **Z-index** value in the settings. You can also use **Side Offset** and **Top Offset** to move the menu away from the edges or header.

= Can I create a horizontal menu? =
Yes, starting from version 7.1, you can choose between a **Vertical** or **Horizontal** layout. Horizontal layout is great for creating sticky bars or toolbars at the top or bottom of your site.

= How can I move my menus to another site? =
The plugin includes an **Import/Export** feature. You can export all your menus or a single menu as a JSON file and then import it into another WordPress site where Float Menu is installed. This is perfect for developers moving from staging to production.

= How can I implement the scenarios mentioned in the "Ideal Uses" section? =
Most of these cases are very easy to set up:
- **Messaging & Social**: Create a new item, pick a Font Awesome icon, and add your link (e.g., `https://wa.me/yournumber` for WhatsApp).
- **Floating CTA & Support**: Use a standard link to your "Contact" or "Booking" page. In the **Pro version**, you can open these in a **Popup** for a better conversion rate.
- **Mobile Experience**: Switch to the **Horizontal Layout**, position it at the bottom, and enable **Mobile Rules** to optimize label display on touch screens.
- **Anchor Navigation**: Use links like `#section-id` to jump to specific parts of your page. The **Pro version** adds **Smooth Scrolling** for this.
- **Membership Access**: Use the dedicated **Login, Register, and Logout** item types already included in the plugin.

= Can I hide the menu on mobile or desktop? =
Yes, the plugin includes **Responsive Visibility** settings. You can use the **"Hide on smaller screens"** option to disable the menu on mobile devices or **"Hide on larger screens"** to hide it on desktops. You can also set custom breakpoint values (in pixels) for these rules.

= Can I display the menu only on specific pages? =
Yes! In the **Lite version**, you can:
- **Show the menu on all pages** of your website.
- **Insert the menu manually** using a **shortcode** `[Float-Menu id="1"]` to display it only where needed.

In the **Pro version**, you can set **advanced display rules** to show the menu only on specific pages, categories, post types, or based on user roles.

= Can I use multiple menus on the same page? =
Yes, you can create and display **multiple menus** on a single page. Each menu has its own settings and can be controlled separately.

= How do I use the plugin on a multisite? =
If you're using a Multisite WordPress installation, **do not activate** the plugin for the entire network. Instead, activate it **individually on each site** where you need it.

= Does Float Menu affect website performance? =
No, **Float Menu is lightweight and optimized for speed**, ensuring minimal impact on your website's performance.
